This thesis examines the relationship between financial inclusion and the promotion of digital wages in a global context, focusing on Algeria, Brazil, Cameroon, India, Japan, Kenya, Norway, and South Africa. The primary objective is to investigate the impact of financial inclusion on the adoption of digital wages, considering various demographic factors such as age, gender, level of education, and income level.To explore this subject, a financial inclusion multidimensional index is constructed using multiple correspondence analysis, capturing various dimensions of financial inclusion. Subsequently, logistic regression, random forest, xgboost, and feed-forward neural network models are employed, utilizing the principal components derived from the index as inputs to predict whether individuals receive digital wages or not. The results reveal that variables describing usage, encompassing the frequency and intensity of financial transactions, have the most significant impact on the prediction models, indicating their crucial role in the adoption of digital wages. While access to financial services also plays a significant role, the study highlights the importance of addressing barriers related to usage, such as digital literacy and ease of use, to promote widespread adoption.
